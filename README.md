# GitHub Markdown Tutorial

This is my GitHubMarkDown tutorial.

This is a repository for my Python program, hello_python_world.py 

Here is an example of an unordered list:
* For a list of things..
* in no particular..
* order

And here is an ordered list:
1. For ranking items...
2. or order of operations...
3. or whatever else. 

## Tasks
A **bold** example.   
Italics for emphasizing *very* important things.      
Strikethrough for removing ~~stupid~~ common mistakes.      
Block quotes:
> "There are three types of people. People who can count, and people who can't."
